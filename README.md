# Simulation of Viscosity-Stratified Flow
#### Link to DiVA: https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1442587 
Implementation of three methods; projection, SAT (Simultaneous Approximation Term) and a hybrid between projection and SAT,
to impose boundary conditions for the viscous Burger's equation.

## Instructions
Choose one of the three methods to impose the boundary conditions and then run the script. 
The script will plot the solution to the Burger's equation, with or without a jump in viscosity. 
To have a jump in viscosity choose two different values on mu1 and mu2.
